# Cardio Vascular Disease Prediction Project

- This project utilizes the Framingham Heart Study dataset, which is a landmark study that has been ongoing for decades in Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset contains valuable information about residents, including their demographic details, behavioral patterns, and medical information.

- The core objective of this project is to develop a robust classification model that can accurately predict a patient's risk of developing coronary heart disease within the next 10 years. We'll explore how various factors like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle choices contribute to cardiovascular risk.
What makes this project particularly significant is its potential real-world impact in preventive healthcare. By identifying high-risk patients early, medical professionals can intervene with preventive measures before serious complications develop.

- Our approach involves several key stages: a) First, we conduct extensive data preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers carefully, considering the sensitive nature of medical data. b) Then, we perform detailed statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to understand relationships between different health factors. c) We implement feature engineering to create more meaningful predictors. d) Finally, we develop and compare various machine learning models, with a special focus on model interpretability, which is crucial in medical applications.
